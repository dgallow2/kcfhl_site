           <h1>Keeper Cup Site Ideas</h1>
           
           <p>A place to store my ideas for the <a href="https://www.kcfhl.com/">KCFHL site</a>.</p>
           
           <h2>Ideas</h2>
           
           <ul>
               <li>Make a draft simulator.</li>
               <li>Have the team points record on the site.</li>
                   <ul>
                       <li>
                       
                       Idea to start: Make the table with the look that I want. In the first column put the rank (1 through 9). No code needed, this will stay the same always. In the next column put the team names. These will need to move depending on their score. Need to figure out how to dynamically rank the teams based on the number attributed to them in the points column.<br>
                       -------<br>
                       To make this standings page I need to make a table with the columns: Rank, Team Name, Total, Points Behind the leader, Points Last Night, Points this week, Points this month, Injured Players, and Man games tonight.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       The names and all of the data will have to be able to move up and down the table based on the teams rank. The rank is based on the total points. Therefore I will have to some how base the position in the table on the number of points a team has. I think this can be done using variables??

                       <br>
                       The total points can just be a sum of the players points that are attributed to the team. That can be js. Look more into js WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions
                       
                       </li>
                   </ul>
                   
               <li>Confetti and popup when the season ends</li>
                   <ul>
                       <li></li>
                   </ul>
               <li></li>
               <li></li>
           </ul>
